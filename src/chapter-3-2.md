Measuring resource consumption and waste generation is a crucial step in assessing your workplace's environmental impact. By tracking these metrics, you can identify areas of inefficiency and waste and develop strategies to reduce your organization's environmental footprint. In this chapter, we will discuss strategies for measuring resource consumption and waste generation.

Measuring Resource Consumption
------------------------------

To measure resource consumption, consider the following strategies:

* Conduct an energy audit: An energy audit can help identify areas where your organization may be wasting energy, such as inefficient lighting or HVAC systems.
* Track water usage: Monitor water consumption through water bills or meters to identify opportunities for water conservation, such as upgrading to low-flow fixtures or implementing rainwater harvesting.
* Monitor fuel consumption: If your organization relies on vehicles or machinery, track fuel consumption to identify opportunities for efficiency improvements, such as implementing idle reduction policies or switching to electric vehicles.

Measuring Waste Generation
--------------------------

To measure waste generation, consider the following strategies:

* Conduct a waste audit: A waste audit involves sorting and weighing different types of waste to identify sources of waste and opportunities for diversion or reduction.
* Track waste streams: Monitor waste streams through waste bills or pick-up logs to identify which materials are generating the most waste and which can be diverted for recycling or composting.
* Implement a waste tracking system: Develop a system for tracking waste generation and diversion over time to monitor progress toward waste reduction goals.

Conclusion
----------

Measuring resource consumption and waste generation is a critical step in assessing your workplace's environmental impact. By conducting energy, water, and fuel audits and monitoring waste streams and generation, organizations can identify areas of inefficiency and waste and develop strategies to reduce their environmental footprint. Remember, sustainability is an ongoing journey, and continuous improvement is key to achieving long-term success.
